# ✨ ScribbleSense AR  

ScribbleSense AR is a collection of **3 experimental AR projects** that blend **computer vision, machine learning, and ARCore** to explore new ways of interacting with the physical world through augmented reality.  

---

## 🚀 Projects Included  

### 1. YOLO Object Detection in Unity (Android)  
- Integrated an **optimized YOLO model** directly inside Unity.  
- Runs **natively on Android** without external servers.  
- Detects objects **in real time** and overlays detection results in the AR view.  

---

### 2. AR Doodle with ARCore  
- Built using **Google ARCore**.  
- Lets you **draw freely in AR space**, and strokes are **anchored to the physical world**.  
- Example: Draw a line in front of you → move around → it stays fixed in place.  

---

### 3. Multimodal Scribble-to-AR (OCR + AR)  
- Write **any message on your phone screen**.  
- Uses **Gemini multimodal OCR** to recognize your handwriting/text.  
- Tap in AR space → the recognized message appears as **anchored AR text**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Unity (C#)**  
- **ARCore SDK**  
- **YOLO (optimized ML model for Unity/Android)**  
- **Google Gemini API (multimodal OCR)**  
- **Android Build (Gradle + Unity Export)**  

---

## 📱 Features at a Glance  
- 🔍 Real-time object detection with YOLO.  
- ✏️ Persistent AR doodling.  
- 📝 Write → OCR → Place text in AR with a tap.  
- ⚡ Optimized for **mobile devices** (tested on Android).
